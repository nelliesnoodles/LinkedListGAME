# LinkedListGAME
A small game to visually learn about nodes in a doubly linked list


Documentation will be added as the game levels are added. 
This was a small experiment and challenge to see if I could gamify the learning of how a doubly linked lists work. 

Future levels will have nodes with pieces of missing information so that the user has to interpolate where they go.

I'd like to also add levels for stacks and queue's but am leaning toward just making these DLL's a little harder to figure out node placement.

In level one, all the information is given.  Hopefully with instructions, even someone who's never attended a comp-sci course can see how these work.
